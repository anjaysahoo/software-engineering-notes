# Tech Context

## Technologies
- JavaScript/TypeScript for solutions where relevant to frontend roles.
- Node-based test runners (Jest/Vitest) likely; verify in repo.

## Development setup
- Run tests via workspace scripts (consult root `package.json` if present).
- Use Prettier/ESLint defaults if configured.

## Constraints
- Keep solutions self-contained and side-effect free for easy testing.
- Prefer iterative solutions unless recursion clarifies intent.
