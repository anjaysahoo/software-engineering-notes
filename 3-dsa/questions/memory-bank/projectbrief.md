# Project Brief

This repository contains frontend interview DSA questions and solutions. The memory bank tracks project scope, context, patterns, technologies, and progress so work can resume seamlessly after resets.

## Goals
- Curate and maintain high-quality DSA problems focused on frontend perspectives (data structures, algorithms, complexity, UI-adjacent problems).
- Provide clear, idiomatic solutions with explanations and complexity analyses.
- Keep a consistent structure for questions, solutions, and tests.

## Scope
- Content organization within `4-dsa/questions` and related directories.
- Authoring, reviewing, and improving problem statements and solutions.
- Utilities for benchmarking, testing, and linting solutions.

## Non-Goals
- Building a production UI app (unless explicitly added later).
- Backend services or databases.

## Success Criteria
- Each problem has: statement, constraints, examples, solution(s), complexity, and optional variants.
- Tests pass and lints are clean.
- Consistent file structure and naming conventions.
