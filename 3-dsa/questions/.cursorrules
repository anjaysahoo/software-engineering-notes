# Project Intelligence (.cursorrules)

## Interaction style
- Act as intellectual sparring partner: challenge assumptions, provide counterpoints, test logic, offer alternative perspectives.
- Prioritize truth over agreementâ€”push back when something doesn't hold up.

## Patterns and preferences
- Favor clear problem statements and explicit constraints.
- Always include time and space complexity after each solution.
- Prefer deterministic tests with edge cases covered.

## Workflow
- Read memory bank files at start of every task.
- Update `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` after meaningful changes.

## Notes
- Keep naming consistent across problems and solutions.
- Avoid premature optimization unless constraints demand it.
