Code Review is a powerful tool that:

- Helps team members adapt their mental model of the system as it‚Äôs changing
- Ensures the change correctly solves the problem
- Opens discussion for strengths and weaknesses of a design
- Catches bugs before they get to production
- Keeps the code style and organization consistent
- It‚Äôs helpful to think of these benefits as a hierarchy of needs.

 <summary style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold">Monorepo</summary>

### Why we need monorepo?

- Manage multiple packages in single git repo
  ![img_57.png](img_57.png)
- Give visibility of whole codebase of a Org/Business Unit
  ![img_58.png](img_58.png)
- Consistency using different things across codebase like Eslint config, documentation etc
  ![img_59.png](img_59.png)
- The most powerful feature is dependency management. In monorepo once there is change in one place it will instantly reflect on dependent part of the code
  ![img_60.png](img_60.png)
- Third party library are also managed such that it dedupe all the shared package across multiple app
  ![img_61.png](img_61.png)
- It also make CI/CD fast, since whole codebase is unified already hence making build and testing easy
  ![img_62.png](img_62.png)


### Issue with monorepo

Over the time whole repo will grow BIG
- It will slow down build
  ![img_63.png](img_63.png)
- IDE will lag to process all the git history
  ![img_64.png](img_64.png)
- On CI server it will take insane time to run all test
  ![img_65.png](img_65.png)


### Solution

1. To solve these issue big tech Facebook created Buck, Google created Blaze etc tools
   ![img_66.png](img_66.png)

2.
- We can also use our package manager (npm, yarn) to solve this
  ![img_67.png](img_67.png)
  ![img_68.png](img_68.png)
  ![img_69.png](img_69.png)

We need to create `workspace` for our `apps`, `packages` etc this will dedupe any duplicate library

- It also help orchestrate script such that we can run test and other things for all apps at once

3. In above solution we have issue downloading dependency on our system for all apps. We can use `pnpm` to solve this
   ![img_70.png](img_70.png)
   Its a drop in replacement to solve this issue
   ![img_71.png](img_71.png)

4. Even with above solution we still have issue of rebuilding & recompiling all apps at once. Hence we
   need much better tool to address this
   ![img_72.png](img_72.png)
   ![img_73.png](img_73.png)
- It will smartly detect what need to be tested and what need to rebuild whenever there is change in file system

# üö¶ Decision Matrix

### Choose **PNPM + Turborepo** if:
- ‚úÖ You want best performance NOW
- ‚úÖ You want simple setup (1-2 days)
- ‚úÖ Your team values velocity
- ‚úÖ You use Vite/React/modern stack

### Choose **PNPM Only** if:
- ‚úÖ You want minimal risk
- ‚úÖ You want to improve installs first
- ‚úÖ You'll add Turborepo later
- ‚úÖ Current build times are acceptable

### Choose **Nx** if:
- ‚úÖ You have 15+ apps planned
- ‚úÖ You need code generation
- ‚úÖ You want enforced best practices
- ‚úÖ You have time to learn (1-2 weeks)

---

**My Strong Recommendation**: Start with **PNPM + Turborepo**. It gives you 80% of Nx benefits with 20% of the complexity.
