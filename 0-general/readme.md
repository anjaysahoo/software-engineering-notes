Code Review is a powerful tool that:

- Helps team members adapt their mental model of the system as it’s changing
- Ensures the change correctly solves the problem
- Opens discussion for strengths and weaknesses of a design
- Catches bugs before they get to production
- Keeps the code style and organization consistent
- It’s helpful to think of these benefits as a hierarchy of needs.
