### Feature Flag

ü§î Have you ever been in a situation where you wished you could launch a feature to a handful of users and then roll it out to 100% of the users based on the feedback/analytics? Or your team just ended up developing a huge feature, but the marketing/product team says we won't launch it yet?

üòñ You end up creating a separate feature branch and trying to keep that in sync with your main branch. But that doesn't end just there. A few weeks later, you want to launch that feature. Now, you'll have to trigger the deployment again. The situation is much worse with mobile apps, where complete rollout takes 2-4 days.

üò≠ Oh! wait? You found an issue. You want to block users from using that feature. Good luck!

üëå To save us, developers, from situations like these we have Feature Flags! Not only developers, it even helps marketing, product, and sales teams.

 <summary style="font-size: small; font-weight: bold">How would you ensure that defects are minimized or minimal possible upon release in production?</summary>

To **minimize defects in production** for **frontend code**, follow a **layered quality approach** covering **development, testing, automation, and monitoring**:

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Strong Development Practices**
‚úÖ **Code Reviews & Pair Programming**
- Enforce **strict PR reviews** with at least **one senior reviewer** to catch logical flaws early.
- Use **pair programming** for complex features to reduce blind spots.

‚úÖ **Strict Type Checking**
- Use **TypeScript** to catch type-related errors at compile time.
- Enforce **strict mode** to prevent implicit type assumptions.

‚úÖ **Linting & Formatting**
- Use **ESLint & Prettier** to enforce code quality and avoid common pitfalls.
- Prevent unused variables, missing dependencies, and inconsistent styling.

‚úÖ **Feature Flags & Incremental Rollout**
- Use **feature flags** to enable/disable new features without redeploying.
- Perform **canary releases** to test with a small percentage of users before full rollout.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Comprehensive Testing Strategy**
‚úÖ **Unit Testing (Jest, Vitest)**
- Cover **critical logic, utility functions, and UI components** to prevent regressions.
- Aim for **at least 80% test coverage** for core functionality.

‚úÖ **Component Testing (React Testing Library, Cypress Component Testing)**
- Test UI interactions, props, and state updates in **isolation**.
- Ensure **UI does not break with different data inputs**.

‚úÖ **Integration Testing (Cypress, Playwright)**
- Simulate **end-to-end user flows** (e.g., login, form submission, navigation).
- Test API interactions and UI updates.

‚úÖ **Visual Regression Testing (Chromatic, Percy)**
- Detect unintended **UI layout shifts** across different browsers/devices.

‚úÖ **Performance Testing (Lighthouse, WebPageTest)**
- Optimize **bundle size, render speed, and API response times** before release.
- Set performance budgets to **prevent slowdowns creeping into production**.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-Release Staging & Monitoring**
‚úÖ **Deploy to a Staging Environment**
- Ensure a **replica of production** is tested before rollout.
- Use **realistic data** to uncover unexpected edge cases.

‚úÖ **Automated Browser & Cross-Device Testing (BrowserStack, SauceLabs)**
- Test against **multiple browsers and devices** to catch compatibility issues.
- Automate tests for **Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge** + **mobile browsers**.

‚úÖ **Error Monitoring & Logging (Sentry, LogRocket, Custom Logging)**
- Integrate **real-time error tracking** to detect issues before users report them.
- Capture **console errors, network failures, and slow UI interactions**.

‚úÖ **Post-Deployment Health Checks**
- Implement **synthetic monitoring** to continuously check if **key user flows** work.
- Set up **alerts** for API failures, high error rates, or performance degradation.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Rollback & Quick Fix Mechanisms**
‚úÖ **Instant Rollback Plan**
- Use **blue-green deployments** or **rollback-friendly CI/CD** for quick reversions.
- Keep **previous stable versions** readily available.

‚úÖ **Hotfix Pipelines**
- Have a **fast-track release process** for urgent fixes in production.
- Automate deployment verification to **detect regressions immediately**.

---

### **Summary ‚Äì Ensuring Minimal Defects in Production**
‚úÖ **Write clean, well-tested code** with strict linting & type checking.  
‚úÖ **Implement thorough testing** (unit, component, integration, UI, and performance).  
‚úÖ **Use feature flags & staged rollouts** to limit impact of new changes.  
‚úÖ **Monitor real-time errors & performance** using logging tools.  
‚úÖ **Prepare for quick rollbacks & hotfixes** to resolve defects fast.
