# System Patterns

## Repository organization
- Problems live under `4-dsa/questions/<category>/<problem>/`.
- Each problem includes a `README.md`, one or more solution files, and tests.

## Design patterns
- Template-driven problem structure with shared utilities as needed.
- Emphasis on pure functions for testability.

## Conventions
- Filenames use kebab-case for folders and camelCase or PascalCase for code identifiers based on language norms.
- Include time and space complexity sections explicitly.
